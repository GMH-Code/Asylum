SDL Asylum
==========

Young Sigmund has a few problems. To help him resolve his mental instability
you must enter the surreal world of his inner mind and shut down the
malfunctioning brain cells. 

SDL Asylum is a C port of the computer game Asylum, which was written by Andy
Southgate in 1994 for the Acorn Archimedes and is now public domain.  It has
been tested on Linux and Cygwin, but it should be possible to run it on other
platforms which support the SDL graphics library.

Installing and running
======================

	make
	sudo make install             # optional
	asylum

You'll need SDL and SDL_mixer.  If you don't have (or don't want to be) root,
you can invoke the game as "./asylum" from this directory.

Instructions
============

The game revolves around shooting anything which moves, collecting anything
which doesn't move, and, most importantly, finding your way to each of the
eight pulsating neurons scattered throughout the immense map.  Use 'Z', 'X',
';' and '.' to move and 'Enter' to fire, or remap the keys to something you
like better.

The one game feature which does merit explicit instruction is teleporting.
In the first level ("Ego") the teleporters look like candelabra.  To use a
teleporter, stand in its centre and press "down" (that's '.' with the
default key settings.)

See the file 'Instruct' for the instructions included with the original game.

Licensing
=========

SDL Asylum is distributed under GPL version 3.  The original game music
and graphics are © Andy Southgate 1993, and have been placed in the public
domain by Andy Southgate.
