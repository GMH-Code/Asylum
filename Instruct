Asylum
======

Young Sigmund has a few problems.  To help him resolve his mental
instability you must enter the surreal world of his inner mind and shut
down the malfunctioning brain cells which are causing him these problems.

Playing
=======

Well, you don't really need any instructions to play the game.  Just
remember, the object is to find things that look like brain cells and
shut them down!  Good luck!

Zones
=====

There are three zones for you to complete, the Ego, Psyche and Id.  You must
complete the Ego before you can tackle the Id.  Try the Ego first.

Controls
========

You can use Acorn standard joysticks - if you have other joystick which don't
work with the game you should contact the supplier to see if they can help.
With a joystick, you can choose one of the mouse buttons as the jump key
using the Define Keys options.

The Options
===========

There are lots of options to select when the game starts up.  Most are self
explanatory.  Here are a few which may not be obvious.

* Speed Tweaks - There are a lot of different Acorn machines available, which
vary in their computing power.  The game will look at the machine when you
first play it and select the ideal combination.  You may change these if you
wish.  Ticked options require more computing power.

* Normal/High Quality Sound - High quality sound takes more computing power.

This New Version
================

Version 2.00 of Asylum has a few new features.  The game is now compressed
using a specially developed technique.  The game is RISC PC compatible, and
can now run in mode 49 for use with VGA monitors.  If for any reason you
don't want to use mode 49 if it is available, press F12 and type:

Set AsylumMode 13

and press return twice.  To return to using mode 49, type Set AsylumMode 49
in the same way.
